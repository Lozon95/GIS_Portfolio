### Applied GIS at Lund University
#### During an advanced course in applied GIS and a site selection task at Lund University, normalisation for spatial data and scale problems for analysis were taught. During this course, optimal cultivation sites for sugar beet in Skåne County were analysed. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of optimal cultivation sites in Skåne County and Figure 2 shows the municipality with the highest area of optimal cultivation land for sugar beet. In Figure 2, an odd trend can be seen in the map where it almost looks like a square of data has been cut out. This is due to the fact that the data available was produced for very small scale (larger areas) and therefore had low resolution. The "cut out" square is thus a pixel where the data value does not meet the requirements for the sugar beet cultivation sites. This highlights the importance of minding the scale for which the data is produced. Site selection was carried out using a raster layer summation method. During the course, great emphasis was placed on multi-criteria analysis, especially AHP (Analytic hierarchy process) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). During an individual assignment, I also explored Fuzzy AHP where uncertainty in expert opinions is taken into account by using fuzzy triangular numbers, which in short means that an expert opinion is given a fuzzy interval instead of a concrete value. This is advantageous when many experts have to weight different criteria against each other and you want to take into account a bias in the assessment. Multi-criteria analysis is common in GIS and I have the skills to carry out these types of projects. With a deep understanding of normalisation and quality control of spatial data, these types of analyses are also performed with high accuracy and reliability. As I also use python scripts in Jupyter Notebook for analysis in ArcGIS, methods can be examined in detail and also reused.

#### During a project in cartography and statistics at Lund University, emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus in a catchment area were analysed. Once this was mapped, an analysis of land use distribution in the area was carried out and proposals for protection zones for the establishment of riperian zones were presented. The result can be seen in Figure 3.

### Raster analysis at Umeå University
#### During the spring of 2023, simultaneously with my bachelor's studies at Skövde University, I studied a 7.5 credit advanced GIS course at Umeå University. During the course, management and analysis of raster data was mainly carried out. During a project, habitat requirements for chanterelles were analyzed in a nature reserve in northern Sweden. The results would be presented as tourist maps for hiking tourists. Thus, the information would appear clearly, but the layout would at the same time invite you to a "treasure hunt for the forest's gold". The results from this project can be seen in figures 4 and 5.
