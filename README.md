## GIS Portfolio
#### Examples of work done during my studies at the University of Skövde and Umeå University. The portfolio is split into two sections. QGIS and ArcGIS.  
##### *(A collection of 6 images with a short description to provide an overview of my skills as a GIS- analysist.)*


### ArcGIS pro

**Figure 1:** A map showing chantarelle habitat for a guided tour in Daimadalens nature reserve. This project was carried out during a course at Umeå University. The analysis was carried out mainly with the raster calculator.

**Figure 2:** A map with a brief explanation for how the analysis was carried out for the chantarelle map.



### QGIS

**Figure 3:** A habitat distribution map for Vendace in Lake mälaren visualising the habitat thickness at different locations. The habitat was calculated with depthdata, temperature and oxygen profiles. The habitat critera was set to temp < 18 degrees celsius and oxygen concentration > 2mg/L. The depthdata was created by digitalising screenshots from Genesis maps (https://www.genesismaps.com/). The parameter profiles was created in R and data was recieved from SLU Environmental monitoring (https://www.slu.se/institutioner/vatten-miljo/forskning/forskningsprojekt/fokus-pa-malaren/miljoanalys/)

**Figure 4:** The map shows the route of flight the vendace need to go if the habitat in one basin shrinks below sufficient volume.
